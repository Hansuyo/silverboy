Make sure to run atom from the command line to get full access to your environment variables. Running Atom from the icon will launch using launchctl's environment.

Script: Run will perform a "File Based" run when no text is selected (default).

Script: Run while text is selected will perform a "Selection Based" run executing just the highlighted code.

Script: Run by Line Number to run using the specified line number. Note that if you select an entire line this number could be off by one due to the way Atom detects numbers while text is selected.

Script: Configure Script should be used to configure command options, program arguments, and environment variables overrides. Environment variables may be input into the options view in the form VARIABLE_NAME_ONE=value;VARIABLE_NAME_TWO="other value";VARIABLE_NAME_3='test'.

Also, in this dialog you can save options as a profile for future use. For example, you can add two profiles, one for python2.7 and another for python3 and run scripts with a specified profile, which will be more convinient than entering options every time you want to switch python versions.

Script: Run with profile allows you to run scripts with saved profiles. Profiles can be added in Script: Run Options dialog.

Script: Kill Process will kill the process but leaves the pane open.

Script: Close View closes the pane and kills the process.

To kill everything, click the close icon in the upper right and just go back to coding.

Script: Copy Run Results copies everything written to the output pane to the clipboard, allowing you to paste it into the editor.
